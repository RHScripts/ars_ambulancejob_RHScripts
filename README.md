Hello, I needed to use the script built by Arius-Scripts for the community, but since the resource was prepared to be used with ox_inventory, and I've been using the Quasar inventory for a long time, I had to add the exports myself. They should be fine, although there might be some errors due to my lack of experience and the fact that I do this in a completely self-taught manner.

I also added the Spanish language in the locales section and the necessary exports to use the D-Phone script by Deun, to save some work for those of you who don't know much but need this little gem.

⭐ What are the modifications made by RHScripts? ⭐

    Added all exports for use with QS-Inventory
    Added ready quasar items.lua
    Added all exports for use with D-Phone (FreeEdition)
    Added Spanish language
